## Description

This is a simplified recreation of Marvel's Superhero Squad Online Card Game created by The Amazing Society and Gazillion Entertainment. It is a two-player, turn-based card game where the objective is to force your opponent to discard all their cards. Cards are all based around Marvel superheroes. 

## Gameplay

Each card has a type, level, block, and attack. A card can be played if its level is lower than or equal to the current game level. The current game level randomly increases by 1 each turn. The opposing player can block a played card if one of the cards in their hand has the corresponding block. Otherwise, they are forced to discard cards from their deck up to the attack amount. There is currently only an AI easy mode.
